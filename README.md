### Docking framework for JavaFX platform

This is a forked version which includes bug fixes and some additions. Namely:

* Ability to dock to a station of smaller size if the node is smaller than 0.5.
* Exit button (partially) works if node is floating.
* Fix bug with substations and station docking happening at the same time.
